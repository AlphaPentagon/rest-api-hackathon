# Week 5 Hackathon

## Build a REST API using Express and PostgreSQL

At the end of our fifth week on the School of Code bootcamp, we were tasked with creating our own REST Api using an Express backend querying a PostgreSQL database hosted in Heroku.

As a pair, we chose to create a Video Game Api that would allow the user to fetch all videogames or a specific videogame, create a new video game, update an existing videogame or delete a videogame.

We created the backend routes and models (which contained SQL queries) for each of these CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete - and as a bonus managed to connect our frontend to fetch and display some data when a button is clicked.

Through this taught me how to connect a backend to a database, how to configure the database to push a table and populate it with data, how to write SQL queries to manipulate that data and then how to integrate that into an Express backend acting as a REST Api. Additionally it taught me how to use the frontend to fetch data from the backend.
